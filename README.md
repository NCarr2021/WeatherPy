# WeatherPy

# Module 6 Challenge - WeatherPy

# Project Description

Using an existing Web API (Application Programming Interface) to gather data specifically to update the
PlanMyTrip app. The updates include adding weather description to existing weather data and using input 
statements, filter data for the user's weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and 
nearby hotels. Google Maps Directions API will be used to create a travel route between four selected
cities and create a marker layer map.
